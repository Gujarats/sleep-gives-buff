# Background
In Normal mode (Non survival mode) sleep becomes something that is useless in the game, or even talking to the inn merchant becomes less attractive due to “I”d like to rent a room. (10 gold)” showing up every time when you talk to them but you never care.

This will at least make it interesting because sleep gives you buff. Yes I’m aware that the current latest game AE version (steam 1.6.1170) already has father’s love and well rested buff. However I still find that it is not enough IMHO :D. Thus I’m creating this buff to make the sleeping mechanics more rewarding but not too powerful.

# Buff List
- Health Regen
  - Triggered whenever the the health is below 70, gradually add 10 health point
- Magicka Regen
  - Add 10% magic regeneration
- Add more Stamina
  - Add 30 stamina (this is the same as 3 level increased)
- Add more health
  - Add 30 health (this is the same as 3 level increased)
- Add more Magic
  - Add 30 magic
